## The Example Build Pipeline
The pipeline will be created using Github Actions.

Although the pipeline runs with github actions, github actions will simply call the `make` commands from the Makefiile in the root folder. (To ensure local experience matches that of the pipeline). 
See [Makefile References](../../README.md)
